Accounting App
 
ðŸ“˜ Project Overview â€”
Accounting App (React + Firebase)
 
 
1. Project Description
 
Our team is developing a simple accounting web application designed for small businesses and self-employed individuals in New Zealand.
The app helps users record their income and expenses and view a basic yearly summary based on the New Zealand tax year (1 April â€“ 31 March).
 
The system includes a role-based structure:
 
Admin â€“ manages users (can block/unblock accounts) and creates shared categories of income and expenses.
Manager â€“ can view all users and their transactions, and leave comments or advice about optimizing spending.
Customer â€“ adds their own income and expense transactions manually, choosing a category created by the admin and optionally adding notes.
Fourth role (TBD) â€“ to be defined later during the project (possibly Accountant or Owner).
 
All data will be stored and managed using Firebase (Firestore + Authentication).

5. Repository Structure (simplified)
 
To keep things easy for beginners, the team will share one GitHub repository with four separate folders, one for each member:
/AccountingApp

  /Vladimir

  /Vraj

  /Viren

  /Arya
 
Each member will work in their own folder (e.g. individual test components, mockups, or feature demos).
Later, the team lead will combine finished parts into the main working version.
 
 
6. Database Structure (Firestore)
 
users

  {uid} â†’ displayName, email, role, blocked, createdAt
 
categories

  {categoryId} â†’ name, type(income/expense), createdAt
 
transactions

  {txId} â†’ userId, type, amount, date, categoryId, note, createdAt
 
comments

  {commentId} â†’ txId, managerId, message, createdAt
 
 
7. Workflow and Collaboration
 
All tasks will be tracked in Jira, under sprints named Week 1, Week 2, etc.
Each Jira ticket will include: short task name, description, assignee, and status (To Do / In Progress / Done).
GitHub commits must include Jira task IDs (e.g. ACC-12 Add customer transaction form).
Weekly short meetings will be held to review progress and adjust roles.
